              <p>
                One day, while Patricia is working in her garden, she hears a
                faint buzzing. She spots from across the yard a large swarm of
                bees in her tree on her property. She is a little scared but she
                knows that bees are important to our environment and knows that
                she doesn't want to harm them, she just doesn't want them in her
                yard.

              />
              <p>
                She takes to her computer and starts by searching for local bee
                removal services. She finds a local Beekeeping Association that
                has a hotline specifically for swarms and gives them a call.

              />
              <p>
                The next day an amateur beekeeper named Scott comes to her home
                and carefully removes the swarm. He tells Patricia that they
                will be going to a local apiary with another member of the
                Portland Metro Beekeeping Association who frequently volunteers
                to rescue swarms.

              />
              <p>
                Over the next few days, Patricia is thinking about all of the
                things Scott told her about bees. He really seemed to love them
                and knew quite a lot about them. She knows that they are
                important for our ecosystem and wants to learn a little
                more...and maybe talk to someone about keeping her own bees.

              />
              <p>
                She logs onto the Portland Metro Beekeeping association like
                Scott recommended and reads lots of very informative and
                interesting facts about bees and beekeeping. She starts to think
                that maybe it wouldn't be soo hard for her to start keeping bees
                for herself.

              <p>
                Patricia decides that she wants to learn more about keeping bees
                and to stay up to date with all the information her local
                association may publish. She also wants to support the work the
                volunteers like Scott do, so she signs up to become a member.

            <p>
              Plain links on the cluttered background are difficult to register.

            <h4 class="text-center">2.Patch Logo</h4>
            <p>
              Cute design, but it doesn’t scale down well and the spacing is not
              consistent.

            <h4 class="text-center">3.Hamburger Menu</h4>
            <p>
              Odd to have both a drop down menu bar and hamburger navigation,
              feels inconsistent.

            <h4 class="text-center">4.Photo on Photo</h4>
            <p>
              Photos need a border or shadow to stand out against the
              background.

            <h4 class="text-center">5.Image Background</h4>
            <p>
              Large scale, full opacity image for a background makes the website
              look cluttered.

            <h4 class="text-center">6.Fonts</h4>
            <p>
              Text is given a different font treatment to draw the user’s
              attention, which is effective but decreases consistency.
