              My process began by analyzing the existing state of my clientâ€™s
              website and identifying what needed to be changed. I started with
              a basic heuristic analysis, where I identified pain points and
              inaccessible features, and then moved to editing down content to
              improve overall user experience.

              </div>
              <p>
                I began by doing a heuristic analysis on the original site to
                determine what would need to be changed. My client was primarily
                focused on redesigning the homepage, so I started there. The
                main issues were determined to be keyboard accessibility, large
                blocks of text that needed to be edited down, and some
                inconsistent styling. The initial points I found included:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Drop down menus were not keyboard accessible</li>
                <li>
                  Green accent color is too light against photo background
                </li>
                <li>
                  Too many large blocks of text that do not serve the user
                </li>
                <li>The call-to-action buttons did not stand out</li>
                <li>
                  The client stories were disjointed and in an inaccessible tab
                  box
                </li>
                <li>The headings were not consistently in a single font</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These, plus insight from my client on what she wanted changed,
                gave me many actionable items to work on as I began the redesign
                process.

                  Although the redesign was focused on the homepage, we
                  determined that content editing for the whole site would
                  greatly improve usability. For efficient content editing that
                  could be easily reviewed by both parties, I copied all website
                  text into a shared Google Doc. We created a key to indicate
                  who was suggesting which edits and took turns reviewing the
                  content. I was able to suggest combining some pages with
                  repetitive content and my client took out blocks of text that
                  were not necessary to get her message across.

            When it came to redesigning content, I focused on ease of use,
            clarity, and consistency. My clientâ€™s priority was the homepage, so
            the majority of my alterations were focused there. I made small
            changes, like making the header fonts consistent, and larger
            changes, like combining sections. I used the existing design as a
            guide as I created new content.

              <p>
                The homepage hero provides the user with the first impression of
                the website. I worked with my client to create a positive,
                affirming tagline that would encourage potential clients to come
                work with her. I changed the font to match the other headers and
                altered the shade of green used to provide higher text contrast.

              <h4 class="p-highlight">Client Stories</h4>
              <p>
                The initial homepage design broke the client stories up into two
                sections, an introduction and resolution within the tabs. It
                felt disconnected, so we decided to combine the stories into a
                singular section within the tabs. I added a photo background to
                match the style of other homepage sections, and emphasized the
                header to provide the user with context.
              </p>

              <p>
                The about section of the initial homepage had large chunks of
                content that was then repeated on the linked page. To improve
                user experience and cut down on text content on the homepage, I
                worked with my client to shorten the introduction to one
                paragraph and moved the button under the content to make the
                continuation more clear.

              <p>
                My client has recently been featured in a number of articles and
                interviews and wanted a media page to reflect those on her
                website. I worked within the constraints of the existing design
                system to create an easy-to-use page that clearly displayed each
                item. I designed it so that it would be easy to update as new
                articles are written, as well.

                Largely, the site looked good and performed well on mobile. The
                only piece my client was not satisfied with was the header,
                which displayed a widget that was out of proportion. I changed
                the widget to a top banner across all sizes, which kept the
                design consistent without compromising the purpose of the
                widget. My client was much happier with this solution and the
                site is now easier to navigate on mobile devices.

              My clientâ€™s main goal for her website redesign was to comply to
              accessibility standards. I focused on ensuring the website was
              visually accessible, usable though keyboard interactions, and
              passed an accessibility checker. Most of the changes made were
              minimal to the overall design, but made the site more usable,
              especially for those with disabilities.

              </div>
              <p>
                The primary accent color did not pass AA level contrast when
                used as a background for white text. Changing it to a slightly
                darker shade allowed for a better contrast ratio without
                compromising the overall visual design. This also approved the
                appearance of colored text on photo backgrounds and, in my
                opinion, improved the color balance of the design system.

                To allow for simple keyboard navigation, I added skip to content
                and skip to navigation to the top of each page. As the menu
                increased in size, I wanted to give keyboard users an easy way
                to navigate to the content without getting bogged down by having
                to navigate through an excessive number of menu items.

                  This gives users a simple option for visual accessibility
                  without relying on their own browser plugins. It does not
                  change the size of headings, which are already large enough to
                  be accessible to minimize disruptions to the overall intent of
                  the design.

                tabindex elements to the tab box and buttons to make the site
                usable by keyboard. I replaced elements where this was not
                possible with alternatives.

                Overall, Iâ€™m happy with my work on this project. I had the
                opportunity to revisit my work after a year and reflected on the
                skills Iâ€™ve gained in that time. I have become much more
                familiar with WordPress and was able to advise my client on a
                handful of performance improvements during my second pass. I was
                also able to identify a couple of accessibility improvements I
                had missed the first time, such as unreadable text against a
                photo background and missing alt text. I am always looking to
                improve my skills and am happy to recognize that this time has
                given me the opportunity to do so. I hope to continue this trend
                of improvement as I work on new projects!
