          Website Redesign: Portland Metro Beekeepers Association
        </h3>
        <div class="content-column justify-center top-pad bottom-pad">
          <h4>Challenge</h4>
          <p>
            The Portland Metro Beekeepers Association (PMBA) is a local
            organization created to connect beekeepers with community resources
            and advocate for environmental justice. As a coursework project, we
            had three weeks to redesign a non-profit website and group I was
            working with saw an opportunity to improve their site accessibility.
            I was tasked with conducting the accessibility analysis, redesigning
            the logo and site architecture, and Figma prototyping.
          </p>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Performing an accessibility analysis, an interview with the
              communications lead of the organization, and research on our
              target audience.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifying redesign goals based on our research and ideating
              potential solutions.
            </li>
            <li>Developing a new style guide, logo, and basic prototypes.</li>
            <li>
              Performing user testing to determine which components would
              perform better.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developing a high fidelity prototype of the finalized design.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Outcome</h4>
          <p>
            The organization liked our design and took some of the research we
            performed into consideration. They have since made some changes to
            their site, including a logo redesign. As we weren’t working
            directly with the site developer, we didn’t take their development
            tools into consideration and many of our suggestions were not
            realistic for the resources they had available. If I were to do this
            project again, I would want to look into their development process
            and develop the design based on what would be most impactful without
            requiring unrealistic resources from an organization of their size.

            Our research focused on what we could do to improve accessibility,
            increase member engagement, and satisfy organizational needs. I was
            the point person on conducting the heuristic and accessibility
            analysis while my teammates conducted research on the target
            audience and met with a representative of the organization.

              </div>
              <p>
                The primary problems I identified with the original website were
                a lack of cohesive styling and issues with readability against
                their choice of a large photo background. The specific points I
                identified were:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Unstyled links are difficult to read.</li>
                <li>Lack of consistent spacing on the logo.</li>
                <li>Highlighted photos blend into the photo background.</li>
                <li>
                  Some site architecture is hidden under a drop down menu.
                </li>
                <li>Header fonts are used inconsistently.</li>
                <li>
                  Overall cluttered feeling, too much information for the
                  homepage.
                </li>
              </ul>

              </div>
              <p>
                We wanted to find out what the average urban beekeeper wanted
                out of a local beekeeping organization. My team members
                developed a survey and found amateur and professional beekeepers
                to participate through social media. We found they valued:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ease of accessibility to educational resources.</li>
                <li>Community events and organizing.</li>
                <li>A place to sell their products and buy beekeeping gear.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="content-column cs-desc">

                />
                <h3>Stakeholder Insight</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Talking to the PMBA communicator revealed that they were more
                concerned about current member experience than gaining new
                members, contrary to our assumptions. They noted interest in a
                public online storefront and member forum, both elements of
                interest by survey respondents as well. They reported that their
                member base is older and may struggle with technology, but wants
                to encourage digital engagement. We used this information to
                then determine what our design priorities would be.

              <h4 class="p-highlight">Redesign Goals</h4>
              <p>
                We initiated our design process by clearly laying out our goals
                and determining what actions we would take to achieve them. This
                provided us with a solid, actionable roadmap as we initiated
                design discussions.

              </div>

              <h4 class="p-highlight">Site Map</h4>
              <p>
                One of the first steps to redesigning the site was remapping the
                site. The existing navigation was confusing and difficult to
                navigate, so I organized content into clear categories that
                prioritized educational resources and membership information.
              </p>

              </div>

              <h4 class="p-highlight">Color Palette</h4>
              <p>
                After much deliberation, we decided on the new color palette as
                a team. We chose to preserve the honey gold and yellow colors
                from the original website design and included shades of purple
                for contrast and because we found out that purple is known to be
                bee’s favorite color of flower. We chose a range of shades to
                ensure accessibility options.

              <h4 class="p-highlight">Logo Design</h4>
              <p>
                Our team wanted to redesign the organization’s logo to reflect
                the new color palette and styling. I took on the task of
                designing the logo. I wanted to preserve the cute look of the
                original patch logo, but also make it reflective of the
                organization with or without accompanying text. I used an
                outline of the state of Oregon with a beehive in the location of
                Portland to represent the physical location and organizational
                activities, all in the new color palette.

            The end goal of this project was a fully functional high-fidelity
            prototype of the website redesign. We built the prototype with our
            design goals and standard practice for modern responsive websites in
            mind. My primary responsibilities were building the navigation
            structure and the educational resources pages of the prototype.

              My intention in building the website navigation was to create a
              structure that was clear and easy-to-use. We wanted to highlight
              the group’s “Swarm Hotline” service that connects beekeepers with
              the general public to remove swarms, so I added a colored dot to
              be able to easily tell whether the service is currently available.
              I used a honeycomb pattern over the header and footer to keep the
              intention of the original site’s photo background but prevent the
              design from looking overcrowded.

              We wanted to create an interactive graphic to display organization
              information to promote engagement instead of simply listing out
              the organization’s priorities. I created this graphic using
              honeycomb imagery to maintain the theme of the website, so each
              hexagon could be clicked and expanded to display information. We
              started simple and then built the graphic into a working prototype
              that saved page space and made the information fun to interact
              with!

              <li>Get feedback on redesign aesthetic choices.</li>

            <p>Questions:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Are users able to effectively and efficiently navigate the
                website?
              </li>
              <li>
                Is the user able to intuitively find the information they are
                looking for?
              </li>

            <p>Hypothesis:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Users will leave the website with less questions than they did
                on the initial website.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Results:</p>

              <li>
                One unsuccessful attempt of objective 4 led us to iterate on our
                honeycomb buttons by adding text directing users to click the
                icons for more information.

            <p>
              The organization enjoyed our new design and decided to go through
              with some website changes after we presented them with our
              project. Unfortunately, because we didn’t factor in their
              development process or digital resources, many of our design
              suggestions were not feasible for them to implement. If I were to
              repeat this project in a professional setting, I would take
              significantly more time taking development constraints into
              consideration and more closely consult with the organization.

            <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
          </div>

          <p>
            Although I would not go about redesigning a site this way again, I
            like what we came up with and am proud of the work I produced. This
            was a good experience for me in terms of having realistic
            development expectations and learning to prioritize organizational
            needs over aesthetics or user needs. If I were to work on this
            project again, I would:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Consult with the website developer and find out what changes are
              realistic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Look into the organization’s other branding materials and stay
              true to their existing aesthetics.
            </li>
            <li>
              Perform user research and testing directly with organization
              members.
            </li>
            <li>Develop further accessibility materials.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Of everything I worked on, I am most proud of the logo design I
            created for this project. I think it captures meaning in a simple
            design and would scale well on merchandise. I am thankful for the
            wonderful team I worked with and hope to find helpful, curious, and
            courteous team members like them again in the future.
