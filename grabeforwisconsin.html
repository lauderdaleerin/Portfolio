          Website Design: Elizabeth Grabe for District 51
        </h3>

        <div class="content-column justify-center">
          <h4>Challenge</h4>
          <p>
            Elizabeth Grabe is running for Wisconsin assembly representing
            district 51, a rural area of southwest Wisconsin. My challenge was
            to design an accessible and exciting website to encourage voters
            from the district to understand her positions, donate to her
            campaign, and participate in her community events.
          </p>
          <h4>Process</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Researched the communities Elizabeth is campaigning to represent
            </li>
            <li>
              Created a website style guide in line with the campaign’s existing
              branding
            </li>
            <li>
              Created high-fidelity website mockups in Figma to review with the
              campaign
            </li>
            <li>Iterated on designs to align with the campaign’s needs</li>
            <li>
              Passed off my designs to our team’s developer to be built in
              WordPress
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Outcome</h4>
          <p>
            Although we do not yet know the election results, the campaign was
            pleased with the result of the website. Since launching the site,
            Elizabeth has gotten significantly more endorsements and has had
            exciting turnout at her community events!

              I got involved with this project through Tech for Campaigns, a
              non-profit that matches technically-skilled individuals with
              democratic candidates to help them with their digital marketing
              strategy. I was placed as a Website Designer to work on Elizabeth
              Grabe’s campaign for Wisconsin’s 51st District Assembly. I worked
              with a Team Lead, Website Developer, and Copywriter to create the
              website over the course of seven weeks.

                <h3>Research</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                I have not lived in or visited the 51st District of Wisconsin,
                so I began the project by researching the area to understand the
                primary users of the website. I looked into the district’s
                demographics, industries, attractions, and popular activities.
                From my research I determined my primary users:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Are mostly white (94%)</li>
                <li>Tend to be older (20% over 65)</li>
                <li>Enjoy outdoor activities such as hunting and fishing</li>
                <li>Live in small towns and rural communities</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </div>

                <h3>Candidate Briefing</h3>
              </div>
              <p>
                Our team had a zoom session with Elizabeth to better understand
                her needs and wants for the website. She explained her
                motivations for running as well as the recent redistricting of
                district 51- opening up an opportunity to flip the seat for
                democrats. She has web design experience and strong aesthetic
                preferences, which I took detailed notes of to ensure the design
                would meet her needs. Her description of the district lined up
                with the research I had done. From these initial research
                points, I had a clear vision to move forward with my design:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Ensure the website is fully accessible for older users</li>
                <li>Highlight nature and the natural beauty of Wisconsin</li>
                <li>
                  Use the existing campaign color palette of blue, green, and
                  white
                </li>
                <li>
                  Prioritize clean, simple design- no italics or artistic fonts
                </li>
              </ul>

              <br />

              <h4 class="p-highlight">Style Guide</h4>
              <p>
                The campaign already had printed marketing materials so it was
                important to maintain brand integrity. I imported the colors
                into my design space, found a suitable font alternative for web
                purposes, and curated an appropriate icon set. I outlined
                spacing guidelines to promote consistency throughout the design
                and used these to begin designing basic web components.
              </p>

                />

              <br />

              <h4 class="p-highlight">Accessibility</h4>
              <p>
                Each design choice was validated by accessibility checks to
                ensure WCAG compliance. I checked every color combination to
                ensure all text and graphics would have enough contrast. I also
                ensured buttons and links on the mobile design were large enough
                to comfortably press and all fonts were clear and readable.

              <h4 class="p-highlight">Favicon Design</h4>
              <p>
                To highlight the campaign’s identity and individuality, I
                created a custom favicon design based on the campaign logo. I
                used the same colors and hill design that Elizabeth said she
                loved, and the number “51” to represent the district she is
                running in.

              <h4 class="p-highlight">Component Design</h4>
              <p>
                Since this website had to be completed quickly and require few
                revisions, I designed modular components that could be easily
                implemented and repeated. Since the campaign wanted to emphasize
                the natural beauty of Wisconsin, I placed most text next to or
                over image highlights. I included a light blue overlay to tie
                the images into the site color palette and create consistency
                throughout the site.

              </div>
              <p>
                My original idea for the homepage hero was to utilize
                Elizabeth’s drone photography to highlight the natural beauty of
                her farm. I was hoping she would be able to provide some
                overhead drone video, but unfortunately that wasn’t possible due
                to time constraints. I received feedback that the farm
                photography was not human enough to connect with voters, so
                photos of people and campaign events were preferred. I updated
                my design to a slide show of pictures of Elizabeth at community
                events and a banner that matched the styling of the other photos
                on the website.

              </div>
              <p>
                I originally proposed a card style for the priorities page to
                keep things clean and organized. Although the card was one of my
                initial component designs, I didn’t end up using it elsewhere
                and it became a one-off component on a single nested page.
                Instead, I swapped the design for the photo highlight style card
                that was used on the homepage and elsewhere on the site to
                promote consistency. I made an image and icon change as
                requested by the campaign as well.

              <p>
                My initial CTA banner design was modelled directly off of a
                template design that was a much sleeker, less naturalistic style
                than we went with for our website. To give the banner dimension,
                I added a photo background and applied an updated button style.
                This elevated the look of the banner to give each page a
                polished feel.

              <p>
                The campaign provided feedback that the “Get Involved” page
                needed to connect more with the individuals visiting the site on
                a personal level and ask for money later. Since we already had a
                donate button in the site header and footer, I agreed and got
                rid of the “Make a Donation” section. I also replaced the CTA
                Banner style of the “Join the Team” section with a photo of
                Elizabeth working with volunteers, to give a personal touch to
                the call-to-action.

                I am very happy with the final result of our work, as was the
                campaign. Our developer did an amazing job translating my
                designs to the web and the campaign has reported positive
                engagement from the site. Although I do not have access to site
                analytics, I feel confident that the site is positively
                contributing to the success of Elizabeth’s campaign!

            <div class="single-row">
              <p>
                As Elizabeth collects endorsements, we will continue updating
                the site with new logos and copy. If I had time to continue
                refining the design, I would:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Perform user testing on users similar to Elizabeth’s target
                  demographic to look for any pain points
                </li>
                <li>
                  Update photos with new images from recent campaign events
                </li>
                <li>
                  Optimize the design for tablet (currently optimized for
                  desktop and mobile)
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Elizabeth’s campaign continues and I await the election results
                in November!

            <div class="single-row">
              <p>
                I felt intimidated working on this project because my team
                members all had a lot more tech industry experience than me.
                This website has the opportunity to make a big impact in an
                important election year, and I’m proud to have been part of the
                team that put it together. Overall, I am extremely happy with
                the results and the abilities I showed throughout this project.
                I felt I did a good job listening to the candidate’s needs and
                wants and implemented them on schedule. I was able to
                communicate effectively with our team’s copywriter and developer
                to produce a cohesive, attractive, and most importantly,
                accessible website that the client is happy with.
              </p>
              <p>
                We were successful in our goals and I hope Elizabeth’s team is
                successful come the election!
